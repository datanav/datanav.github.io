between the Partner and the Customer/End User is valid and the SaaS Services are a
part of the separate service agreement and generates income for Sesam. In cases

in a way that affects the SaaS Services so income is no longer generated for Sesam, the
Partner will no longer be eliglible for the 15% discount from Sesam.</p>
<p>4.1.5. To be eligible for the 15% discount the Partner must be a Sesam Certified Solution
Partner, cf section 2.3 and section 6.1.2.</p>
