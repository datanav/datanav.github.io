<p>Terms of Service for Access and Use of SESAM Software as a Service
(SaaS)</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="purpose">
<h3>1.1. Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>This document contains terms of service for Customers’ access to and
use of SESAM Software as a Service (“Services”) provided by SESAM.IO AS
922 409 676 (“SESAM”). The services consist of both free- and paid
subscriptions and the term “Customer” is used regardless of whether a
Subscription Fee applies to a particular Customer’s account. Some
sections of this document will only apply to Customers with an account
with a defined Subscription Fee. Upon ordering access to the Services,
and confirming acceptance of the terms of service in this document, a
legally binding agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between SESAM
and the Customer. All Services, as they are available at any time,
through the portal <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.sesam.io">https://portal.sesam.io</a>, are subject to the terms of
this Agreement.</p>
<p>Upon entering into this Agreement and the registration of the Customer
in SESAM’s systems, the Customer is given a right to use the Services on
the terms in this Agreement. Once access to the Services has been
granted, the Customer will receive an e-mail to its registered e-mail
address with the necessary access and login details.</p>
<p>The Services consist of various sub-services, and the right to use the
Services only comprise the individual sub-services which the Customer
has ordered, and received access to. Some of the Services are payable.
The Customer’s account overview sets out active sub-services which the
Customer has ordered, including which Services are payable.</p>
<p>Some sub-services may be subject to additional terms and/or
restrictions. Such additional terms and/or restrictions are set out in
the terms of use for the sub-service together with the description of
the sub-service in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="description-of-the-services">
<h3>1.2. Description of the Services<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-the-services" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The Services are standardized services, and the Customer acknowledges
that the functionality in the Services will change. The Customer is
given the right to use the Services, with the functionality as provided
from time to time. The right to use the Services is not connected to any
specific version of the underlying software or any set functionality as
provided at any time, but is rather connected to access to and use of
the Services as they are at any given time. Details of the functionality
of each of the Services can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.sesam.io">https://docs.sesam.io</a>.</p>

<h2>2. The Right to use the Services<a class="headerlink" href="#the-right-to-use-the-services" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="general">
<h3>2.1. General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The Customer may set up Users and give these Users access to the
Services with different roles (each individual referred to herein as a
“User” and collectively as the “Users”). Users consist of natural
persons in the employment or service of the Customer.</p>
<p>The Customer and the Customer’s Users receive a worldwide, limited,
terminable, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the Services
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, exclusively for the
Customer’s internal business purposes. This right is conditional on the
payment of the applicable subscription fee and other fees (“Subscription
Fee”). Any applicable Subscription Fee is provided on the Customer’s
account overview.</p>
<p>The Payment of the Subscription Fee and the compliance with the terms of
this Agreement is a precondition for the right to use the Services.</p>
<p>SESAM may adjust the agreed Subscription Fee yearly, upon 3 months’
written notice. In case of changes in public taxes, charges or other
duties or other changes in public administrative practice affects the
vendor’s costs connected to the Service, the Subscription Fee may be
adjusted correspondingly without prior notice.</p>
<p>The Customer may not allow a third party to use the Services in a
service bureau or similar, or offer services dependent on the Services

<p>Dynamic price model:</p>
<p>The price model is a dynamic (running) price model that is renewed

<p>A fixed price model entails that Sesam gives a 50% discount of a set
amount of data (GB), based on the dynamic price and provided that the
Customer in the Agreement agrees to the fixed price model for a
renewable term of 12 months.</p>
<p>If the Parties agrees upon fixed price, the Agreement will be for a term
of 12 months calculated from the date it is agreed between the parties
that the model is fixed price (most often the Date the Agreement is
signed by both parties). If the Customer uses more data than the agreed
upon fixed price model allows for that term, the fee for the data amount
(GB) surpassing the agreed upon fixed price, will be double of what
follows from the dynamic price model.</p>
<p>The Agreement will automatically be renewed with the same data amount
(GB) for the following 12 months as that of the running term, unless the
Customer gives at least one (1) month written notice prior to the
expiration of the running term that they do not want to continue with
the fixed price model at all, or if they want to make adjust to a higher
or lower fixed price model for the following 12 months term. Renewals

<p>The Customer shall hold SESAM harmless against all costs, damages,

<h2>15. Disputes<a class="headerlink" href="#disputes" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Any dispute or disagreement arising between the parties will be resolved
by negotiations.</p>
<p>If such negotiations fail, either party may request that the case is
brought before a Norwegian court. If the parties so agree, the case
shall be decided by arbitration after Norwegian Act of 14. May 2004 no.
25 on arbitration. If the parties require confidential treatment of the
arbitration proceedings, hereunder the arbitration court’s verdict, this
shall be agreed between the parties in writing together with the
arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>The agreed legal venue shall be the location where SESAM has its
registered address when the case is made before the court or arbitration
court.</p>
<p>The following dispute resolution shall apply to the Customers who pay a
Subscription Fee:</p>
<p>The parties will strive to resolve all disputes at the project
management level. If any such dispute cannot be mutually resolved by the
project managers within 7 days, then such dispute will immediately be
referred to the parties’ respective division vice presidents (or
equivalents) for discussion and resolution. If such parties fail to
resolve the dispute within 14 days, then such dispute will be referred
to the party’s respective Chief Operating Officer (or equivalent) for
discussion and attempted resolution. If such dispute cannot be mutually
resolved by such parties within 14 days, then either party may request
that the case is brought before a Norwegian court. If the parties so
agree, the case shall be decided by arbitration after Norwegian Act of
14. May 2004 no. 25 on arbitration. If the parties require confidential
treatment of the arbitration proceedings, hereunder the arbitration
court’s verdict, this shall be agreed between the parties in writing
together with the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>The agreed legal venue shall be the location SESAM has its registered
address when the case is made before the court or arbitration court.</p>
