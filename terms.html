<div class="section" id="purpose">
<h3>1.1. Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This document contains terms of service for Customers’ access to and
use of SESAM Software as a Service (“Services”) provided by SESAM.IO AS
922 409 676 (“SESAM”). The services consist of both free- and paid
subscriptions and the term “Customer” is used regardless of whether a
Subscription Fee applies to a particular Customer’s account. Some
sections of this document will only apply to Customers with an account
with a defined Subscription Fee. Upon ordering access to the Services,
and confirming acceptance of the terms of service in this document, a
legally binding agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between SESAM
and the Customer. All Services, as they are available at any time,
through the portal <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.sesam.io">https://portal.sesam.io</a>, are subject to the terms of
this Agreement.</p>
<p>Upon entering into this Agreement and the registration of the Customer
in SESAM’s systems, the Customer is given a right to use the Services on
the terms in this Agreement. Once access to the Services has been
granted, the Customer will receive an e-mail to its registered e-mail
address with the necessary access and login details.</p>
<p>The Services consist of various sub-services, and the right to use the
Services only comprise the individual sub-services which the Customer
has ordered, and received access to. Some of the Services are payable.
The Customer’s account overview sets out active sub-services which the
Customer has ordered, including which Services are payable.</p>
<p>Some sub-services may be subject to additional terms and/or
restrictions. Such additional terms and/or restrictions are set out in
the terms of use for the sub-service together with the description of
the sub-service in question.</p>

<div class="section" id="description-of-the-services">
<h3>1.2. Description of the Services<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-the-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Services are standardized services, and the Customer acknowledges
that the functionality in the Services will change. The Customer is
given the right to use the Services, with the functionality as provided
from time to time. The right to use the Services is not connected to any
specific version of the underlying software or any set functionality as
provided at any time, but is rather connected to access to and use of
the Services as they are at any given time. Details of the functionality
of each of the Services can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.sesam.io">https://docs.sesam.io</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="general">
<h3>2.1. General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Customer may set up Users and give these Users access to the
Services with different roles (each individual referred to herein as a
“User” and collectively as the “Users”). Users consist of natural
persons in the employment or service of the Customer.</p>
<p>The Customer and the Customer’s Users receive a worldwide, limited,
terminable, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the Services
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, exclusively for the
Customer’s internal business purposes. This right is conditional on the
payment of the applicable subscription fee and other fees (“Subscription
Fee”). Any applicable Subscription Fee is provided on the Customer’s
account overview.</p>
<p>The Payment of the Subscription Fee and the compliance with the terms of
this Agreement is a precondition for the right to use the Services.</p>
<p>SESAM may adjust the agreed Subscription Fee yearly, upon 3 months’
written notice. In case of changes in public taxes, charges or other
duties or other changes in public administrative practice affects the
vendor’s costs connected to the Service, the Subscription Fee may be
adjusted correspondingly without prior notice.</p>
<p>The Customer may not allow a third party to use the Services in a
service bureau or similar, or offer services dependent on the Services
to a third party. However, the Customer may allow in- hire consultants
or temporary employees to use the Services for Customers internal
business purposes. The Customer may also use the Services to
collect/deliver data from the applications and databases of the
Customer’s suppliers and/or customers.</p>
<p>The Services depend on standard software. When purchasing access to the
Services, the Customer does not purchase a copy of, or license to, the
software used to deliver the Services, but consecutively pay for a
subscription to access the Services. To the extent that separate
license- or other terms apply for use of third party software and/or
services included in the Services, these are set out together with the
description of the Services in question. Any terms for third party
software and/or services take precedence over the terms of this
Agreement.</p>

<h3>2.2. The relationship between the Customer’s Users and SESAM<a class="headerlink" href="#the-relationship-between-the-customer-s-users-and-sesam" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Customer commits to adhere to the terms of this Agreement, and to
ensure that any of its Users do the same. The Customer accepts the full
responsibility for all activities connected to its Users, and its User’s
compliance with the terms of the Agreement. When the individual User
accepts any terms upon logging into a Service, or on a later change of
such terms, no Agreement is made between such individual User and SESAM.
It is at all times the Customer who is party to any agreement with
SESAM, and who has all rights and obligations set out in such agreement.</p>
<p>The Customer accepts that SESAM may contact the Customer, and any
Customer administrators, through registered e-mail addresses and through
telephone, and provide general marketing information or other
information about the Services. Such information will not be sent to the
Customer’s other Users.</p>

<h3>2.3. User administration<a class="headerlink" href="#user-administration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the Customer is a physical person, the Customer will be assigned a
single User.</p>
<p>If the Customer is a legal person, Users are created and administrated
by the Customer. Customer’s administrators for this Agreement should be
communicated to SESAM.</p>
<p>The logon information of an individual User shall not be shared or used
by more than one physical person, but may freely be reassigned by the
Customer’s administrator. The Customer’s administrator may also name
further administrators and delete Users. The Customer shall ensure that
all information about Users and administrators are up to date at all
times.</p>
<p>Each User is responsible for keeping his/her username and password
confidential. The Customer shall inform SESAM immediately in case of
unauthorized use of a User’s logon information. Users are authorized to
provide SESAM’s support personnel with access to their accounts where
such access is necessary to provide support or else asked for by the
User.</p>

<h3>2.4. Requirements for use of the Services<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-for-use-of-the-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Customer and any of its Users shall not transfer viruses, malware or
any other harmful code to the Services or use the Services in a manner
which gives a risk for such transfer. The Services shall not be used for
any illegal or otherwise unauthorized purpose. When the Services are
used outside of Norway, in cases where the Customer’s Users temporarily
are staying abroad, the Customer is responsible for complying with the
Norwegian, EU and United States of America export restrictions and
-regulations, including assuring that the Services are not used in
jurisdictions where such use would be contrary to such export
restrictions and -regulations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-information">
<h2>3. Technical information<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Services will be delivered through the operating environment
selected by SESAM at any time, unless it is agreed with the Customer
that the Customer will use another operating environment. The Customer
will be given minimum three months’ notice in case of significant
changes to the operating environment. SESAM reserves the right to change
the operating environment, but will in such event notify the Customer of
the change and of technical and legal effects of such change.</p>
<p>At the present time the operating environment selected by SESAM is
Microsoft Azure. For Azure, separate terms of service apply from
Microsoft:

These terms apply as amended and updated by Microsoft at any time. SESAM
has no responsibility for error and defects in such services.</p>
<p>SESAM and the Customer may agree on special requirements for the
operating environment in a separate agreement.</p>
<p>To the extent technical requirements apply to the Customer’s IT systems
for the use of the various Services, e.g. requirements for bandwidth
and/or hardware, this shall be set out together with the description of
the Services in question.</p>

their subscription to that particular service in accordance with the

e.g. storage in SESAM’s operating environments, cf. section 3 above,
unless otherwise is agreed with the Customer.</p>
<p>If the Services entail processing of the Customer’s personal data, the
Data Processing Addendum comes into force. The Data Processing Addendum
forms part of the Terms Of Service. The Data Processing Addendum are
hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Customer
Data includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. The DPA further
states the Parties’ obligations and rights as Controller and Processor,
regarding the Processor’s processing of Personal Data on behalf of the
Controller. SESAM as the Processor, shall only process data in

<h2>6. Fees and Payment Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#fees-and-payment-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For Services included in this Agreement, the Customer may have payed a
Subscription Fee to SESAM as set out together with the description of
the Services in question.</p>
<p>Dynamic price model:</p>
<p>The price model is a dynamic (running) price model that is renewed
automatically until terminated by one of the parties as set out in
section 11.</p>
<p>Fixed price model:</p>
<p>A fixed price model entails that Sesam gives a 50% discount of a set
amount of data (GB), based on the dynamic price and provided that the
Customer in the Agreement agrees to the fixed price model for a
renewable term of 12 months.</p>
<p>If the Parties agrees upon fixed price, the Agreement will be for a term
of 12 months calculated from the date it is agreed between the parties
that the model is fixed price (most often the Date the Agreement is
signed by both parties). If the Customer uses more data than the agreed
upon fixed price model allows for that term, the fee for the data amount
(GB) surpassing the agreed upon fixed price, will be double of what
follows from the dynamic price model.</p>
<p>The Agreement will automatically be renewed with the same data amount
(GB) for the following 12 months as that of the running term, unless the
Customer gives at least one (1) month written notice prior to the
expiration of the running term that they do not want to continue with
the fixed price model at all, or if they want to make adjust to a higher
or lower fixed price model for the following 12 months term. Renewals
each 12 months will continue as long as the Agreement is running.</p>
<p>The Parties can additionally agree upon a support level of 24/7 provided
that the Customer has agreed to a fixed price model of 50 GB/month or
higher.</p>

<p>SESAM shall, to the extent SESAM is responsible for the infringement,

may at its own discretion (i) modify the Services so that there is no
longer any infringement of third party rights, (ii) replace the Services
with functionally equivalent services, (iii) provide a right for the
Customer’s continued use of the Services. If these options are not
available, SESAM may terminate the Customer’s access to the Products and
Services with a refund of any fees paid for the subscription after the

trade secrets, trademark or any other intellectual property rights.
SESAM shall immediately notify the Customer in writing in the event of
such claims.</p>
<p>The Customer shall hold SESAM harmless against all costs, damages,
expenses or losses that SESAM is sentenced to pay by a court or
agrees to in a settlement, including attorney fees, provided that SESAM
cooperates with the Customer at the Customers own expense and that SESAM
provides the Customer with full control over the legal process and
