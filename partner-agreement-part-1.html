section 6.1.2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-collaboration">
<h1>3. The Collaboration<a class="headerlink" href="#the-collaboration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>3.1. Partner’s Rights: Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Sesam
grants the Partner a non- exclusive, terminable, worldwide right to
market and distribute the SaaS Services and necessary documentation to
Customers/End Users, including all modifications, enhancements,
upgrades, and new versions and releases of the SaaS Services, or parts
thereof, and the right to sublicense to Customers/End Users.</p>
<p>3.2. Business development: The Parties will actively seek and pursue
market innovation opportunities and, without undue delay, keep each
other informed of such opportunities.</p>
<p>3.3. Application Programming
Interface (API): Responsibility and costs related to the development of
new APIs shall be discussed and agreed between the parties for each new
development. Unless otherwise agreed, Sesam shall own all APIs in
connection with the SaaS Services, whether developed before, during or
after termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>3.4. No exclusivity: Nothing in this
Agreement implies that the Partner receives exclusivity for resale,
integrated sales and total sales, cf. section 2.2 above. During the

</div>
<div class="section" id="collaborative-results-and-discount">
<h1>4. Collaborative Results and Discount<a class="headerlink" href="#collaborative-results-and-discount" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>4.1. The Collaborative Results and Discount for Partner re-sale:</p>
<p>4.1.1. When the Partner markets/provides/sells the SaaS Services to
Customers/End Users as described in 2.2.1 , the Partner enters into
agreement and invoices the Customer/End User themselves.</p>
<p>4.1.2. The Partner will have their own user in portal.sesam.io upon signing this Agreement
and accepting the Terms of Service. The Partner must then register each new
Customers/End Users in the portal by making subscriptions for them. The
Customer/End User will thus gain access to the SaaS Services. Partner must make sure
that the Customer/End User has signed the Terms of Service before access is given to
the SaaS services.</p>
<p>4.1.3. To qualify for the 15% disocunt, the Partner must run and drive the process, as well as
invoice the Customer/End User. For the avoidance of doubt, the discount is 15% of
monthly revenue on the SaaS Services for each Customer/End User, calculating from
the Effective Date of the signed Terms of Service by the Customer/End User.</p>
<p>4.1.4. The Partner is eligible for a 15% discount for as long as the separate service agreement
between the Partner and the Customer/End User is valid and the SaaS Services are a
part of the separate service agreement and generates income for Sesam. In cases
where the professional relationship between Partner and Customer/End User changes,
in a way that affects the SaaS Services so income is no longer generated for Sesam, the
Partner will no longer be eliglible for the 15% discount from Sesam.</p>
<p>4.1.5. To be eligible for the 15% discount the Partner must be a Sesam Certified Solution
Partner, cf section 2.3 and section 6.1.2.</p>
<p>4.2. The 15% discount will be delivered to the Partner as a discount on
the monthly invoice from Sesam. Sesam will subtract the 15% on the
monthly invoice on the SaaS Services as they are calculated for each
Customer/End User.</p>
<p>4.3. All discounts to Partner under this Agreement is depending on, and
subject to (where applicable), the Terms of Service Appendix 2 –
Subscription Fee, payment terms.</p>
