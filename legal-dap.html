Where Personal Data is stored in the operating environment that is part of the
Processor’s Services, the Processor shall only monitor and provide support
on the Services and not process the Personal Data in any way other than
what is stipulated in the Principal Agreement. If the Controller wants the
Processor to carry out any other form of processing of the Personal Data, the
Controller must make the request by a written change order to the Processor.
Further/other processing of the Personal Data as a result of such a change
order may lead to increased costs for the Processor and must thus be
covered by the Controller, see section 2.5.</p>
<p>2.1.7 Where the Controller stores the Personal Data in their own operating
environment, the Processor will not be able to access the Personal Data
unless the Controller provides such access. The Processor shall monitor and
provide support on the Services and not process the Personal Data in any
way other than what is stipulated in the Principal Agreement. If the Controller
wants the Processor to carry out any other form of processing of the Personal
Data, the Controller must make the request by a written change order to the
Processor and then provide access to the Personal Data. Further/other
processing of the Personal Data as a result of such a change order may lead
to increased costs for the Processor and must thus be covered by the
Controller, see section 2.5.</p>

<p>2.4.1 The Processor shall only process the Personal Data on behalf of the
Controller and on written instructions from the Controller, unless Processing
is required by Applicable Laws to which the Processor is subject, in which
case the Processor shall to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws inform
the Controller of that legal requirement before the relevant Processing. The
Processor shall only process the Personal Data for the sole purpose and to
the extent necessary to provide the Services, in accordance with the terms in
this Agreement and Applicable Laws.</p>
<p>2.4.2 The Processor does not have the right of use of the Personal Data, and may
therefore not process them for their own purposes under any circumstances.</p>
<p>2.4.3 The Processor has carried out the technical and organizational security
measures as described in this Agreement’s section 4, in order to protect the
Personal Data from loss, misuse or un-authorized alternation or
dissemination, or against other illegal processing. These measures represent
a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing,
taking into account the costs of the implementation.</p>
<p>2.4.4 The Processor shall give the Controller access to its applicable security
documentation, and in other respects assist, so that the Controller may
comply with his own responsibilities according to Applicable Laws.</p>
<p>2.4.5 The Controller has, unless otherwise agreed or pursuant to Applicable Laws,
the right to access the Personal Data being processed and the systems used
for this purpose. The Processor shall provide necessary assistance for such
access to be given.</p>
<p>2.4.6 The Processor is subject to confidentiality regarding the documentation and
the Personal Data for which it gains access to under this Agreement. This
provision also applies after the termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.4.7 The Processor may freely choose where it geographically stores the Personal
Data, although in such a manner that the Personal Data shall not be stored in
countries outside of EU/EEA without a separate written agreement or the
transfer/storage being included in a special arrangement (e.g. “SCC”). The
Controller may at any time require information on where the Personal Data is
stored.</p>
<p>2.4.8 The Processor shall, without undue delay, notify the Controller on any
request from governmental authorities or the police regarding the disclosure
of the Personal Data, unless this is prohibited (e.g. prohibited by the Penal
Code to preserve the confidentiality of an investigation), on any unauthorized
access to or unauthorized disclosure of the Personal Data (see section 7.1)
and on any request received directly from a Data Subject, without answering
the request unless otherwise authorized to do so. The Processor will only
disclose the Personal Data to governmental authorities or the police when
legally obliged to do so, e.g. court order, judgement, order with a basis in law
or similar.</p>
<p>2.5 In the case that the Controller’s instructions or the Processor’s
assistance to the Controller lead to increased costs for the Processor
compared to what was initially agreed upon between the parties, the
Controller shall compensate the Processor for the increased cost in
accordance with the Processor’s regular terms and hourly rates.</p>

<p>4.1 Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing
as well as the risk of varying likelihood and
severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Processor shall in relation to
the Personal Data implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk, including, as appropriate, the measures
referred to in GDPR Article 32 (1). The safeguards are designed to prevent accidental or
unlawful destructions, loss, alteration, unauthorized access, security oversight and
enforcement.</p>
<p>4.2 In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Processor shall
take account in particular of the risks that are presented by
Processing, in particular from a Personal Data Breach.</p>
<p>4.3 The Controller confirms that the Processor has provided sufficient
guarantees that they will implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures that ensure that the processing meets the
requirements of Applicable Laws, hereunder the protection of the Data
Subjects’ rights.</p>
<p>4.4 The Controller confirms to have assessed any security measures
specifically stated in the Principal Agreement and thus accepted by the
Controller, and the Controller is responsible (as between the parties
and to data subjects and supervisory authorities) if those measures in
themselves do not meet the GDPR standard of appropriateness. In the
assessment the Controller has taken into account that any pre-stated
description may only deal with specific aspects of the required security
arrangements rather than describing a comprehensive solution.</p>
<p>4.5 The Processor will maintain the measures for the protection of
security, confidentiality and integrity of the Personal Data. Measures
are described in our Privacy Policies and is set fort in the Principal

<p>5.5.1 before the Subprocessor’s first processing of the Personal Data (or, where
relevant, in accordance with section 5.2), ensure that the Subprocessor does
not process Personal Data covered by this Agreement in any way that is not
necessary for the performance of the Services, and that the Personal Data is
not given to anyone else without this being specified in this Agreement or is
permitted by the Controller in a prior written notice;</p>
<p>5.5.2 ensure that the arrangement between the Processor and the Subprocessor,
is governed by a written contract including terms which offer at least the

<p>5.5.3 provide to the Controller for review such copies of the Processors’
agreements with Subprocessors (which may be redacted to remove
confidential commercial information not relevant to the requirements of this
Agreement) as the Controller may request from time to time.</p>
<p>5.6 Processing of Personal Data outside of the EU/EEA</p>
<p>5.6.1 If the agreement between the Processor and the Subprocessor involves a
transfer to a Third Country, the Standard Contractual Clauses must at all
relevant times be incorporated into the agreement between the Processor
and the Subprocessor. Or, prior to the Subprocessor’s first processing of
Personal Data, the Processor must ensure that the Subprocessor enters into
an independent agreement with the Controller that incorporates the Standard
Contractual Clauses;</p>
<p>5.6.2 If the Processor is to enter into an agreement with Subprocessors in
countries outside the EU/EEA, this should only be done according to EU
model agreements for the transfer of personal data to Third Countries, or
other applicable legal grounds for transfers to Third Countries in accordance
with GDPR Chapter 5. The same applies even if Personal Data is stored in
the EU/EEA when personnel with access to the data are located outside the
EU/EEA.</p>
